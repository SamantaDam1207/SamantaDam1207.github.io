            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Toronto, with a passion for designing 
                and building interactive robots. My technical skills include programming in C++, Verilog, Arduino C++, and more. 
                I have worked on numerous projects, from robot construction to software-defined radios and plant monitoring systems.
